<span>"I was alone. Maybe it was my fault" - Tomoyoshi Yamamoto (Developer). Tomoyoshi Yamamoto has been developing a virtual reality program that creates an avatar that moves talks and does almost anything the cloned person would do in real life. "We have reached 60% in terms of progress" - Shawk Stanberg (BETA tester). The project is about to complete and is scheduled to have its first launch on December.</span><br><span>"I didnt have many friends I can depend on, especially when I was in 8th grade... I was totally isolated." Developer Tomo (Tomyoshi Yamamoto) invisions a new kind of network for kids like him to interact. "Its really hard to find where you belong when you have a totally different interest then others". His life, mainly on how he thinks of his life changed when he first experienced VR. "I was surprised on what I would be able to do with this technology. <i>I can make my own world to stay and build my very own shelter".</i></span><br><br>
<a id="itro" style="font-size: 18px;" href="/#itro">About the Project</a><br>
<span><i>Report from 10/1/16 follows:</i> In this report, we will like to introduce the prototype of our AR Avatar Creator that heavily uses the structure of WebGL and Machine Learning.</span><br><span>The project is running on <a href="https://prazma.github.io/augr">this link </a>(https://prazma.github.io/augr). The code is saved on <a href="https://github.com/prazma/augr">GitHub</a>. The while program uses three elements to fit and structure several algorithms through the use of <strong>objects and variables</strong>. The algorithms will visualize the result through a VR experience by using <strong>WebGL and Accelerometer (HTML5 Sensor API)</strong>.<br> Geolocation API will be added to let the users interact with the world. ("experiencing kinetic energy is very important for us, humans in the VR world" -Tomoyoshi Yamamoto). <strong>"The cloning technology may lead to a new technology of where we humans can interact with people gone from this world."</strong> - Beta Tester</span><br><br>
